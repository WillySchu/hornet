"""Codegen

Transforms the AST produced by parser.py into x64 assembly (AT&T syntax).

This follows the classic two-stage codegen structure used by many
introductory compilers:

    AST (parser.py)  -->  Assembly AST  -->  Assembly text

Keeping the "Assembly AST" as its own intermediate representation --
rather than emitting strings directly from the source AST -- makes this
much easier to extend later. Once expressions get more complex you'll
need to allocate registers/stack slots as part of building that assembly
AST; once you add more statements you'll add more instruction types.
None of that should require touching the string-formatting code at all,
and none of the string-formatting quirks (spacing, symbol prefixes, etc.)
should leak into the code-generation logic.

Supported so far (matches what parser.py can currently produce):

    Program  -> one or more Functions
    Function -> a name and a body of statements
    Return   -> evaluate an expression into %eax, then `ret`
    Constant -> an immediate value
    Unary    -> NEGATE ('-'), COMPLEMENT ('~'), and NOT ('!'), each
                applied in place to whatever's already in the
                destination register
    Binary   -> ADD ('+'), SUBTRACT ('-'), MULTIPLY ('*'), DIVIDE ('/'),
                the six comparisons (== != < > <= >=), and the two
                short-circuiting logical operators (and, or)

Unlike Constant, a Unary expression can't be represented as a bare
Operand (there's no such thing as "the immediate value of `-2`" as an
assembly-level concept -- the negation has to actually happen on a
register). So expression codegen works by emitting instructions that
compute the expression's value directly into a destination (see
`gen_expr_into`), rather than by returning an Operand. Nested unary
operators fall out of this for free: `~-2` recurses inward first
(computing -2 into %eax), then applies the outer operator to whatever's
now sitting in that register (`notl %eax`).

BINARY OPERATORS AND THE ONE-REGISTER PROBLEM
------------------------------------------------
Binary operators need *two* operand values alive at once (left and
right), but `gen_expr_into` only has one destination register to work
with -- there's no register allocator yet to hand out a second one. The
fix used here is the classic minimal-effort answer: spill to the real
CPU stack.

To compute `left OP right` into `dst` (%eax):
  1. Compute `left` into %eax (the usual gen_expr_into).
  2. `pushq %rax` -- save that value on the stack.
  3. Compute `right` into %eax -- safe to reuse, since `left` is on the
     stack now.
  4. `movl %eax, %ecx` -- move `right` out of the way into a scratch
     register.
  5. `popq %rax` -- restore `left` back into %eax.
  6. Emit the actual operator instruction combining %ecx into %eax.

Because this always pushes before recursing into the right-hand side and
pops after, nested binary expressions of any depth resolve correctly:
each push/pop pair is balanced within its own gen_binary_into call
regardless of what further pushes and pops happen inside step 3, so the
stack naturally behaves like an expression-evaluation stack. This is not
efficient (a real register allocator would keep far more values in
registers), but it's correct at arbitrary nesting depth, which is what
matters before you have one.

COMPARISONS
-----------
The six comparison operators (== != < > <= >=) reuse that exact scheme
-- both sides always get evaluated -- but combine with cmpl + setCC +
movzbl instead of an arithmetic instruction: cmpl sets flags from
(left - right), setCC turns the relevant flag pattern into a 0/1 byte,
movzbl zero-extends it to fill the register. This is the same trick
logical NOT already used against a fixed comparand of 0 (see
gen_unary_op); comparisons just generalize it to comparing against a
computed `right` and to all six condition codes instead of only 'e'.

AND / OR: SHORT-CIRCUITING
---------------------------
AND and OR are NOT routed through the stack-spill scheme above, because
that scheme always evaluates both operands -- exactly what short-circuit
evaluation must avoid. `a and b` must not evaluate `b` at all if `a` is
already false, and `a or b` must not evaluate `b` at all if `a` is
already true.

Instead, gen_short_circuit emits real control flow: evaluate the left
side, compare it to 0, and conditionally jump straight past the code
that would evaluate the right side. AND and OR are mirror images of each
other and share one implementation:

    AND (jump early on left == 0, early result 0, fallthrough result 1):
        <left>              ; -> %eax
        cmpl $0, %eax
        je   .Land_short_N  ; left was false -- skip right entirely
        <right>             ; -> %eax
        cmpl $0, %eax
        je   .Land_short_N  ; right was false
        movl $1, %eax
        jmp  .Land_end_N
    .Land_short_N:
        movl $0, %eax
    .Land_end_N:

    OR is the same shape with the jump condition, early value, and
    fallthrough value each flipped (jne / 1 / 0).

Because the jump genuinely skips over the right-hand side's instructions
at runtime -- they're present in the binary but never executed -- this
is real short-circuiting, not just a coincidentally-correct value. That
distinction is externally observable: `0 and (1 / 0)` returns 0 without
crashing, while `1 and (1 / 0)` does crash (SIGFPE), because only in the
second case does control flow ever reach the division.
